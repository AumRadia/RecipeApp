🍽️ Recipe App

This Flutter app allows users to discover and explore a variety of recipes through a clean and simple interface. Users can search for recipes, view detailed instructions by opening the original recipe URLs, bookmark their favorites, filter recipes by type, and share them with others. Bookmarked recipes are saved locally using Shared Preferences for quick access even after restarting the app.
